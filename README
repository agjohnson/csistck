NAME
    Csistck - Perl extension for blah blah blah

SYNOPSIS
    A simple example of using csistck to create an executable management
    script:

        use Csistck;
    
        for my $host (qw/a b/) {
            host $host => role('test');
        }

        host 'c' => role('test');
    
        role 'test' => 
            template(".files/test.tt", "/tmp/test", { text => "Some text here" }),
            permission("/tmp/test*", mode => '0777', uid => 100, gid => 100);
    
        check;

    The script can then be called directly, using command line arguements
    below

DESCRIPTION
    Csistck is a configuration management tool that falls somewhere in
    between the management tools slack and chef.

    The model of csistck is more complex than slack, requiring syntax
    knowledge of Perl and knowledge of csistck calls. However, having used
    slack for a short period of time -- and having struggled to adapt
    slightly more complex usage to slacks's simplistic model -- csistck was
    designed under a similar philosophy goal to keep usage as simple as
    possible.

    To say chef is more complex than csistck is a heavy understatement. The
    model of csistck clearly pulls from chef, however the aim of csistck
    isn't meant to be a mere port of chef to Perl. Where both chef and
    csistck aim to provide consistency checks, csistck does not aim to
    provide the depth of checks and resolution that chef provides.

SCRIPT USAGE
    The following options are recognized in a csistck based script

    --okay  Display okay returns on tests

    --fail  Display failure returns on tests

    --debug Display debug messages

    --diff  Display file diff and test differences

    --fix   Fix differences in files and tests
