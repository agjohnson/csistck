NAME
    Csistck - Perl system consistency check framework

SYNOPSIS
    A simple example of using csistck to create an executable management
    script:

        use Csistck;
    
        for my $host (qw/a b/) {
            host $host => role('test');
        }

        host 'c' => role('test');
    
        role 'test' => 
            template(".files/test.tt", "/tmp/test", { text => "Some text here" }),
            permission("/tmp/test*", mode => '0777', uid => 100, gid => 100);
    
        check;

    The script can then be called directly, using command line arguements
    below
