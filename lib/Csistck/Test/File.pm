=head1 NAME

Csistck::Test::File - Csistck file check

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=head2 file($target, :$src, :$mode, :$uid, :$gid)

Copy file C<$src> to C<$target>, setting additional options with named
arguments such as mode and uid.

    role 'test' => file(
        '/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf',
        src => 'lighttpd/lighttpd.conf',
        mode => '0644'
    );

This method takes the following named parameters:

=over

=item B<src>

Source file for copying

=item B<mode>

Change target file mode. This should be a string representation of the octal
mode of the target file -- eg. '0644'

=item B<uid>

Change target UID to the specified integer value.

=item B<gid>

Change target GID to the specified integer value.

=item B<on_repair>

If a repair operation is run, this coderef is called by the process method.
